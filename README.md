📊 Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series Data
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates seasonal decomposition on time series data using Python.
The goal is to break a time series into its core components:

Trend – long-term movement

Seasonality – repeating patterns

Residual / Noise – random variation

This helps in understanding data behavior and is commonly used in forecasting, finance, and analytics.

The project is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook and a sample CSV dataset.
